I am a second-year PhD student in Political Behavior at the [Department of Government](https://www.lse.ac.uk/government) at LSE. 
My supervisors are 
[Melissa Sands](https://www.melissasands.org/), 
[Sara Hobolt](https://hobolt.com/) and 
[Florian Foos](http://www.florianfoos.net/").

In my thesis, I aim to explore how individuals' local environments influence political behavior, 
using micro-level geospatial data to disentangle the material impacts of rising regional inequality 
and the unique social identities shaped by the spatial divide between urban and rural citizens.
